    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                In large bowl, beat 1.5 cups powdered sugar, the softened butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 
                the almond extract and egg with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon, until 
                well blended. Stir in flour, baking soda and cream of tartar. Divide dough in half; shape 
                dough into 2 disks, and wrap in plastic wrap. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oven to 375Â°F.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Roll each disk on lightly floured surface until 0.25 inch thick. Cut with 2-2.5-inch cookie 
                cutters into desired shapes. On ungreased cookie sheets, place cutouts at least 2 inches apart. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake 7 to 8 minutes or until edges are light brown. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheets to 
                cooling racks. Cool completely. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In medium bowl, beat 3 cups powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons milk and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla with 
                spoon until smooth and spreadable. If frosting is too stiff to spread, add additional milk, 
                1 teaspoon at a time. Tint with food color. Spread frosting on cooled cookies. Decorate as 
                desired with colored sugar or candy sprinkles. Let stand about 4 hours or until frosting is 
                set. Store covered in airtight container at room temperature with waxed paper between layers.
