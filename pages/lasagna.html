    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook 
                over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 
                tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce 
                mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, 
                and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil 
                to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if 
                necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage 
                cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture 
                over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 
                30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.
            </p>
