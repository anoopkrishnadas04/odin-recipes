    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add 
                shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 
                minutes, flipping halfway through. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to 
                remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside. 
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until 
                vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push 
                vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, 
                stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season 
                with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.
